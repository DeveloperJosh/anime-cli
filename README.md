# Anime-CLI

My project is a cli for watching anime just like [anipy-cli](https://github.com/sdaqo/anipy-cli/tree/master) and [ani-cli](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli/), my cli is not fast at all but I'm working on that, feel free to give it a try tho.


## How to run

Download the code using git, Then run "npm i" after that you can run

```
node src/main.js watch
```

and it should work
