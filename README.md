# NekoNode

NekoNode is a playful and powerful command-line interface tool for anime lovers, built on Node.js. It brings the joy of anime to your terminal, making it easy to search, manage, and explore anime content.

## What's it made with?

I built NekoNode using Node.js, and I used the following libraries:

- [Commander.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) for building command-line interfaces.
- [Inquirer.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for interactive command-line prompts.
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) for making HTTP requests.
- [Chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) for styling the terminal output.
- [Ora](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ora) for displaying loading spinners.
- [Figlet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/figlet) for creating ASCII art from text.
- [Consumet](https://github.com/consumet/api.consumet.org) I used this for fetching the streaming links for the anime. (Hosted on a secure server.)
